# Scoring Calculation Fix

## Issue Identified
- Frontend calculates score correctly (350 for High Complexity)
- Production API returns score 0 due to mismatched questions structure
- Local API works correctly with score 350

## Fix Applied
- Updated API questions to match frontend structure exactly
- Added debugging logs to track calculation process
- Verified local calculation works: score 350, High Complexity, 3-6 months

## Deploy Commands
```bash
git add api/index.js
git commit -m "Fix scoring calculation by updating questions structure to match frontend"
git push origin main
```

After deployment, the production app will correctly calculate and store scores matching the frontend preview.
