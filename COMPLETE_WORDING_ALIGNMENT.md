# Complete Scoring Reference Alignment

## Fixed Issues
✓ Frontend/backend scoring calculation mismatch
✓ Complexity classification thresholds alignment  
✓ Exact wording match with scoring reference

## Changes Applied
1. **API Scoring Logic (api/index.js)**
   - Updated questions structure to match frontend
   - Fixed complexity thresholds (500+ = Very High, 200-499 = High)
   - Aligned exact wording with scoring reference

2. **Server Storage Logic (server/storage.ts)**
   - Updated complexity and time estimation functions
   - Applied exact scoring reference wording

3. **Frontend Components**
   - Updated add-request-modal.tsx with exact wording
   - Updated edit-request-modal.tsx with exact wording

## Verified Results
- Score 550: "Very high complexity or effort" (RED section)
- Score 280: "High complexity or effort" (YELLOW section)
- Time estimates include full description with "construction phase with max capacity"

## Deploy Commands
```bash
git add api/index.js server/storage.ts client/src/components/
git commit -m "Align all scoring text with exact scoring reference wording"
git push origin main
```

Production will now display scoring exactly as shown in the reference guide.
