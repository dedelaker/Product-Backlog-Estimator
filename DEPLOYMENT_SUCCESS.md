# Ready for Deployment - Conflict Resolved

## Files Cleaned Up
- Removed conflicting api/index.ts, api/requests.ts, api/[...route].ts
- Kept only: api/index.js and api/hello.js (backup)
- Updated all frontend components to use /api/index

## Push Final Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Clean up API conflicts - remove duplicate serverless functions for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Next Steps After Push
1. Vercel will automatically redeploy
2. Set DATABASE_URL environment variable in Vercel dashboard
3. Application will be fully functional

The conflict has been resolved - only one serverless function per endpoint now exists.
