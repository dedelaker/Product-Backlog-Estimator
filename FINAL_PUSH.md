# Final Deployment Commands

The API structure is now clean with only `api/index.js`. 

Run these commands to deploy:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove conflicting API files - single api/index.js for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

After pushing:
1. Vercel will automatically redeploy successfully
2. Add your DATABASE_URL environment variable in Vercel dashboard
3. Your Product Backlog Estimator will be live and functional

The conflict is resolved - only one API file remains.
