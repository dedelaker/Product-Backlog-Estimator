# Scoring Mismatch Fix - Complete Question Structure Alignment

## Root Cause Identified
- Frontend: 11 questions from shared/questions.ts 
- Backend API: 10 questions (missing security_analysis question)
- Result: Frontend calculates score 525, backend stores score 375

## Missing Question Analysis
The backend was missing this critical question:
```javascript
{
  id: "security_analysis",
  text: "Do we have complex analysis of IT security? or Legal? (ex: for big impacts / critical outsourcing, AI guidelines)",
  options: [
    { text: "No", score: 0 },
    { text: "Yes, with potential big impacts on solution", score: 150 },
    { text: "Yes, but no impact on solution", score: 20 }
  ]
}
```

## Score Impact
- Missing question can contribute up to 150 points
- This explains the 150-point gap (525 frontend - 375 backend = 150)

## Fix Applied
- Added missing security_analysis question to api/index.js
- Now backend has complete 11-question structure matching frontend
- All scoring values and complexity thresholds aligned

## Verification Required
After deployment, test with same inputs:
- Frontend preview: 525 points
- Backend storage: should also be 525 points
