# Scoring Mismatch Fix - Question Structure Alignment

## Root Cause Identified
- Frontend: 10 questions from shared/questions.ts
- Backend API: 14 questions (mismatched structure)
- Result: Frontend calculates score 200, backend stores score 100

## Debug Evidence
```
Frontend calculated score: 200
Data being sent to backend: {"title":"test44444","answers":["Yes, standard API, already used by lot of other clients","","","","","","","","","Yes, and big impact on current one"]}
```

## Fix Applied
- Updated api/index.js to use exact same 10 questions as frontend
- Aligned question structure with shared/questions.ts
- Maintained exact scoring values and complexity thresholds

## Deploy Commands
```bash
git add api/index.js
git commit -m "Fix scoring mismatch by aligning backend questions with frontend"
git push origin main
```

After deployment, frontend score calculations will match backend storage exactly.
