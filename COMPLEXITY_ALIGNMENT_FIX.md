# Complexity Classification Fix

## Issue Fixed
- Backend classified score 475 as "Very High Complexity" 
- Scoring reference shows 200-500 should be "High Complexity"
- Frontend and backend had misaligned thresholds

## Changes Applied
- Updated backend complexity thresholds to match scoring reference:
  - 500+: Very High Complexity (Red)
  - 200-499: High Complexity (Yellow) 
  - 100-199: Medium Complexity
  - 0-99: Low Complexity

- Updated time estimation to match:
  - 500+: More than 6 months
  - 200-499: 3-6 months
  - 100-199: 1-3 months
  - 0-99: Less than 1 month

## Local Test Results
- Score 400: "High Complexity", "3-6 months" ✓
- Score 550: "Very High Complexity", "More than 6 months" ✓

## Deploy Commands
```bash
git add api/index.js
git commit -m "Fix complexity classification to match scoring reference"
git push origin main
```

After deployment, score 475 will correctly show as "High Complexity" instead of "Very High Complexity".
