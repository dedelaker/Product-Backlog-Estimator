# Complete Vercel Deployment Solution

## Step 1: Get Your Neon Database Connection String

1. Go to your Neon Dashboard: https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Connection Details" or "Settings"
4. Copy the connection string that looks like:
   `postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require`

## Step 2: Update Frontend to Use Correct API Endpoint

Since Vercel is having issues with /api/hello, I'll update the frontend to use /api/index:

```bash
# Commands to run in your terminal:
git add .
git commit -m "Add api/index.js for Vercel deployment - complete serverless function"
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variable in Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `product-backlog-estimator`
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Click "Environment Variables" in the sidebar
5. Add new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Neon connection string (from Step 1)
   - **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development (check all)
6. Click "Save"

## Step 4: Redeploy

After setting the environment variable:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab in Vercel
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

## Expected Result

Your Product Backlog Estimator will be fully functional at:
`https://product-backlog-estimator.vercel.app`

With complete features:
- 10-question estimation form
- Automatic scoring and complexity calculation
- Database persistence with Neon PostgreSQL
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## Troubleshooting

If you still get database errors:
1. Verify the DATABASE_URL is correctly set in Vercel environment variables
2. Check that the connection string includes `?sslmode=require` at the end
3. Ensure your Neon database is active and not sleeping

The api/index.js file I created will handle all API operations and should deploy successfully to Vercel.
