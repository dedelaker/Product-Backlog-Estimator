# Complete Deployment Solution

## Current Status
✓ Frontend building successfully (490KB bundle)
✓ Neon database connected and operational
✓ Local API working with 6 test requests
✗ Production API endpoint missing from deployment

## Solution: Push API Endpoint

Run these commands to deploy the working API:

```bash
git add api/index.ts api/requests.ts
git commit -m "Add serverless API endpoints for production"
git push origin main
```

## Files Ready for Deployment
- `api/index.ts` - Main API endpoint (simplified)
- `api/requests.ts` - Full API with all features
- `vercel.json` - Correct build configuration
- Database connection tested and working

## After Deployment
Your Product Backlog Estimator will have:
- Complete scoring system with 10 business questions
- Complexity calculation (Low/Medium/High/Very High)
- Timeline estimation (weeks to months)
- Persistent storage in Neon PostgreSQL
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete)
