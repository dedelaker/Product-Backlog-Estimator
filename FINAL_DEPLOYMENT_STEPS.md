# Final Deployment Steps for Product Backlog Estimator

## 1. Push All Changes to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Vercel deployment setup with api/index.js serverless function"
git push origin main
```

## 2. Get Your Neon Database URL

From your Neon dashboard (the interface you showed), you need to:
1. Navigate to your project settings
2. Find the connection string that looks like:
   `postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx-xxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require`

## 3. Configure Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `product-backlog-estimator` project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - **Name**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your complete Neon connection string
   - **Environments**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Save the variable

## 4. Trigger Deployment

After setting the environment variable:
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click "Redeploy" on the latest build
- Or push another commit to trigger automatic deployment

## What This Fixes

- The `api/index.js` file handles all CRUD operations for your backlog requests
- Uses proper CommonJS exports that Vercel recognizes
- Includes complete scoring algorithm with 10-question assessment
- Connects to your Neon PostgreSQL database
- Supports all HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

## Expected Result

Your application will be fully functional at your Vercel URL with:
- Complete backlog request management
- 10-question estimation system
- Automatic complexity scoring (Low/Medium/High/Very High)
- Time estimates (1 week to 6+ months)
- Real database persistence

The deployment should succeed because I've removed the problematic runtime configurations and created a clean serverless function structure.
