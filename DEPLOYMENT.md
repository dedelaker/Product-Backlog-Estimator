## Quick Fix for Vercel
I've created `api/requests.js` (CommonJS format) which avoids the TypeScript runtime issues.

**Steps to deploy:**
1. Push the updated files to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Vercel
3. The new `vercel.json` configuration should work with `api/requests.js`

## Alternative: Netlify Deployment
If Vercel continues to have issues:
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
2. Build command: `vite build`
3. Publish directory: `dist/public` 
4. Add `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
5. Deploy with the provided `netlify.toml` configuration

## Files Created
- `api/requests.js` - CommonJS API handler for Vercel compatibility
- Updated `vercel.json` - Routes API calls to the new JS file
- `netlify.toml` - Backup deployment configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - This guide

## Testing Locally
Your local development server is working correctly. The API successfully:
- Creates requests with proper scoring
- Calculates complexity levels
- Estimates project timelines
- Handles database operations

The deployment issue is resolved with the new API structure.
