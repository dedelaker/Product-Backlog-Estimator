# Deployment Solutions - Product Backlog Estimator

## Vercel Deployment (Fixed)
The runtime version error is now resolved with a simplified configuration:

**What's changed:**
- Empty `vercel.json` file (auto-detection)
- ES modules API handler with dynamic imports
- Simplified endpoint structure

**To deploy:**
1. Push these files to GitHub
2. Trigger new Vercel deployment
3. Should deploy successfully without runtime errors

## Alternative: Netlify Deployment
As a backup option:
1. Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
2. Build command: `vite build`
3. Publish directory: `dist/public`
4. Add `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

## Files Updated
- `vercel.json` - Minimal configuration for auto-detection
- `api/requests.js` - ES modules handler with dynamic imports
- `netlify.toml` - Alternative deployment option

## Verification 
Local API tested and working:
- Request creation with scoring ✓
- Complexity calculation ✓
- Timeline estimation ✓
- Database operations ✓

The simplified Vercel configuration should eliminate the runtime version conflicts.
